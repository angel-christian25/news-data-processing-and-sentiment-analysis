# News Data Processing and Sentiment Analysis


## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to process and analyze Reuters news articles by performing data transformation and sentiment analysis. The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Data Transformation and Storage:**
   - Extract and transform data from Reuters SGM files.
   - Store the transformed data in MongoDB.
   - Perform word frequency analysis using Apache Spark to identify the most and least common words in the news articles.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Implement a Bag-of-Words (BOW) model in Java to analyze the sentiment of news article titles.
   - Classify each news title as positive, negative, or neutral based on the frequency of positive and negative words.

The project demonstrates the use of NoSQL databases, big data processing frameworks, and basic sentiment analysis techniques, providing a comprehensive approach to handling and analyzing large text datasets.
