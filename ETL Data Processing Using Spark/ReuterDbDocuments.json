  "body": "External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the US action against Canadian potash exports but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute In the latest flashpoint in CanadianUS trade relations the US International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million US dlrs last year were injuring the US industry We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period But he said the opposition parties should be careful not to raise false alarms too early The case now goes before the US Commerce Departments trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed Potash producers from New Mexico claiming unfair government subsidies are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canadas shipments Canada the worlds largest potash producer exported 98 mln metric tonnes of potash last year with nearly a third going to the US Most of the potash used in the production of fertilizer comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan In the Commons Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another trade harrassment from the US and criticized Clarks assurances the countrys interests would be protected We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled Axworthy said Canadas Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the US Axworthy urged the government to present Canadas case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the US What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system Clark said Meanwhile Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide he said Its caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer whether its potash fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer or whatever"

  "body": "China must cut excess demand and capital investment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficits but will press ahead with wideranging economic reforms in 1987 Premier Zhao Ziyang told parliament Zhao told the annual meeting of the National Peoples Congress that while China cooled its overheated economy cut its trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986 serious imbalances remain Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply and demand for consumer goods especially from state firms is too high They squander public funds to a serious extent  and issue excessive wage and bonus increases he said Failure to cut this excess will result in reduced accumulation of fundsAnd serve to corrupt social morality Zhao said He said there was a contradiction between low per capita incomes and excessively high consumer demand China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction in its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption must match the available resources he said Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986 because of the sharp fall in world oil prices the rising cost of foreign exchange earnings through exports reduced income from customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending Local authorities departments and firms have been able to retain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979 They unjustifiably developed processing industries and nonproductive construction Zhao said He said that unless effective measures are taken to curb this practice financial and credit deficits are likely to increase in the next few years Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last too long they will cause the overissue of money which in turn will cause disturbing inflation a precipitous rise in commodity prices and chaos in economic life Another serious problem is that too many new construction projects have been launched Fixed asset investment outside the state plan is overextended and the pattern of such investment is highly irrational he said Investment in energy transport telecommunications and raw and semifinished materials industries is inadequate and investment in nonproductive projects is too large he said Zhao said some departments and local authorities have failed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this investment imbalance despite instructions to do so from the State Council earlier this year He said Chinas per capita output of grain and other farm and sideline products is still very low and production of grain forestry animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a rather weak foundation Chinas countryside is still in the development stage and there is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms he said but did not elaborate Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe life into Chinas large and medium sized state firms which still do not have a satisfactory combination of responsibilities powers and benefits We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises full managerial authority and full responsibility for their own profits and losses he said Currently the firms are not responding rationally to market changes and doing all the state requires of them he said Their potential is not being fully tapped he added Zhao said that in 1987 China will speed up the reform of its financial system diversify credit services encourage competition among different financial institutions and promote insurance services He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed with differential and floating rates being applied for different periods of time China must under proper guidance develop markets for the circulation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of financial markets in pooling and regulating funds he added Zhao said China must also expand the market for capital goods such as rolled steel coal cement and timber The lack of such a market is the main reason why large state firms have yet to be fully invigorated he said He also promised a continuation of the labour contract system under which all firms hire workers for a fixed period and pay them according to their own methods subject only to stateset ceilings for wages and bonuses REUTER"

  "body": "The head of a Philippine panel charged with selling the nonperforming assets of government financial institutions said some 100 stateowned companies would also be put up for privatisation But David SyCip chief executive trustee of the Asset Privatisation Trust APT told a meeting of financial executives the APT has not yet received a list of the firms I believe lead investor groups people who see longterm potential are willing to buy such companies in full and do a handson job of running them SyCip said SyCip said open bidding would be used to sell all assets handled by the APT He said bidding would be either openpriced if there were enough serious contenders or the APT would set a target price for acquisition He added that the target price did not constitute a rigid floor What we consider an acceptable price is a price at which an investor will earn an adequate return he said SyCip said the bulk of the APTs current work relates to the nonperforming assets of the stateowned Development Bank of the Philippines DBP and the Philippine National Bank PNB The APT was set up in January SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400odd assets that the DBP and the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the form of financial assets In some cases financial assets have been converted into physical assets by foreclosures They are fairly cut and dried because we are dealing with mostly whole production facilities like textile or foodprocessing plants he said Financial assets are more complicated The only recourse is to foreclose gain titles and try to sell the asset but the laws here tend to favour the debtors he added SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecution by its charter many debtors are tying up the panel with litigation If you see some of the situations we have to work our way through you will see that our symbol a Gordian knot is an apt illustration he said SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16 of the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the high costs involved When you do your arithmetic you realise that if you did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of the assets book exposure he said SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos who originally owned many of the bankrupt companies would buy them back through the privatisation scheme We just look at the bottom line which is to monetise these assets to the maximum degree possible he said We are selling for cash it is not our concern where it comes from He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about the identities of buyers that Marcos cronies could easily put up legitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from bidding for assets on the block I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100peso bills all with identical serial numbers and they look like genuine legal currency then I would accept them SyCip said He said some participants in the governments debtequity swap scheme were interested in buying nonperforming assets with the pesos they receive from such deals The problem is government regulations slow down approval of debtequity plans and the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look at investment funds earmarked for nonperforming asset purchases he said It would greatly facilitate matters SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24 billion pesos of the assets total worth of 108 billion President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month that proceeds from the sale of APTcontrolled assets would be used to finance the governments land reform program which aims to distribute about 97 mln hectares of land to poor peasants Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers SyCip said How much money has the country to lose because of this Filipinos first slogan How many people have become millionaires and then forgotten the Philippines and put their money in the United States or Australia REUTER"

  "body": "British banks are resisting signing a 76 billion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditch effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new 77 billion dlr loan contained in the package Christopher Brougham regional manager rescheduling unit at Lloyds Bank Plc said in response to a  enquiry that the six major UK Clearing banks last week sent a telex to Citibank saying they would contribute what was requested provided all other major lenders did the same and that the US Banks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by them Other bankers who declined to be identified said other groups of banks particularly those in Switzerland France and Canada were equally reluctant to sign although they had not sent any telex to Citibank which chairs Mexicos 13bank advisory group However they said it was likely that if and when the British banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow Under the agreement for which the signing began on Friday commercial banks are being asked to contribute 129 pct of their exposure to Mexico as of August 1982 That was the date of the first Mexican debt crisis After months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreement for Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington Ever since then the advisory group of which Lloyds is a member has been attempting to round up the needed signatories However there has been considerable resistance to the package partly because of some of the clauses it contains and partly because many small US Regional banks do not want to increase their exposure to any Latin American countries Brougham said We British banks have always played along for Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six clearers jointly but each sent its own telex In addition to Lloyds telexes were sent by National Westminster Bank Plc Barclays Bank Plc Midland Bank Plc tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc Brougham noted that so far the US Banks have only reached 8312 pct of the total that is expected from them while the level of contributions from the UK Banks is well in excess of 90 pct The US Figure should be closer to ours he said Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the regional US Banks noting that even if they dont contribute to the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the existing loans The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and bankers are hoping all will go according to plan In the meantime bankers expect further pressure will be exercised on the regional banks and the major US Banks to find a solution to the problem Many have suggested that the larger US Banks should take on the additional obligations but so far they have resisted this Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the US Banks will come from US Regulators notably the Federal Reserve Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British banks and other national groups as a matter of principal and burden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force the US Banks to make up their share The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the protracted negotiations surrounding the agreement The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays At the signing in New York last Friday Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will continue to be open and willing to share with them the business opportunities which its future growth will create Petricioli said Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico is one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their exposure But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in February in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package On Friday Petricioli said We will be a lot more expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have supported us The pressure on the US Banks comes at a time when other major Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt negotiations Brazil the third worlds largest debtor has suspended all interest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt Many of the major US Banks including Citibank have already said they might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and take the financial losses which could total billions of dollars This would be required by US Banking regulations if the interest payments are more than 90 days overdue However the US Banks are not the only ones threatened by regulations In the UK A proposed Inland Revenue ruling would affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans many of which are made to Latin American countries Basically the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank can claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan interest payments The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as their implementation could prove extremely costly not just in terms of compliance but in limiting future business REUTER"

  "body": "The release of UK February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg up from a 73 mln surplus in January has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates analysts said Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg against the official figure of 224 mln stg sharply narrower than Januarys 527 mln deficit The figures are unreservedly good Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said Sterling rebounded on the trade figures reversing a weaker morning trend to stand at 721 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday unchanged from yesterdays close but 03 points above the 1100 GMT level The market had feared that a deteriorating nonoil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling which has been the motor behind the recent fall in UK Interest rates Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 95 pct from the present 100 pct was really on the cards But sentiment now looks to have turned about again There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 25 billion stg will be exceeded said Wroblewski Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 716 billion stg from 673 billion in January Exports rose to a record 693 billion from 620 billion However Chris Tinker UK Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months He forecast the Chancellors Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods However Ian Harwood economist at Warburg Securities said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 175 billion stg He said news of strong growth in exports of nonoil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry The growth in imports appears to be flattening even if Januarys bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and importintensive stock building among manufactureres Harwood said UK Government bonds or gilts surged by more than 12 point on the betterthanexpected news as earlier worries about the figures evaporated Sterling peaked at a high of 16075 dlrs before settling to a steady 16050 dlrs about 1300 GMT nearly a cent higher than the European low of 15960 However analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative governments support was slipping The Marplan poll published in Today showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct from 38 pct last month while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct from 21 pct to run neck and neck with the Labour Party whose own support fell from 38 pct The poll was taken after the Budget which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent political observers said Another regular poll is due tomorrow and eonomists warn that todays improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again This upsetting of the markets political perceptions which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election made them more sensitive to the trade data Harwood said The news did come as a very very substantial relief he said However on the interest rate front economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall They noted Lawson had already got an inflationreducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed REUTER"

  "body": "US trade representative Clayton Yeutter said that if Congress were to require trade retaliation it would only close markets and would result in less trade In remarks prepared for an address to members of the University of Chicagos Graduate School of Business Yeutter said many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly protectionist yet their undeniable effect would be to close off market opportunitites just as exchange rate movement is unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several years Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite the Presidents comprehensive competitiveness initiative there are many in Congress who still are supporting trade bills containing many dangerous provisions Yuetter said Yeutter said many countries would prefer US retaliation to opening their own markets We should be intelligent enough to not let them off the hook that easily he said He said that tough but flexible legislative language is infinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirable limits on Presidential discretion he said Limiting the Presidents ability to consider all available options on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise Yeutter said That could readily provoke retaliation which would unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars injuring most competitive export industries Yeutter said present US trade laws are fundamentally sound President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliation eight times in the last 18 months  most recently in the case of Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets He took these steps as a last resort only after carefully analyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis and only after determining that such actions would open markets to American exports he said Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve the US trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone He added that the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomic policy shortcomings here and abroad"

  "body": "Brazils financial crisis is rapidly becoming a political and social crisis and President Jose Sarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the United States this week political analysts say Sarneys administration has never appeared weaker The full political price which Sarney will have to pay for the failure of the muchvaunted antiinflation Cruzado Plan is still not clear He might have to pay with the presidency Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to pick a successor to Sarney early next year The length of his term will be decided by a Constituent Assembly and Sarney has been lobbying for a sixyear term Sarney came to power without facing presidential elections in March 1985 when the military bowed out after 21 years of rule Although there was wide public support for direct elections for president the military as one of their last acts insisted an electoral college where it felt it had more influence make the choice The college chose Tancredo Neves a popular politician who headed the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party PMDB which had opposed military rule In part to smooth relations with the military Neves chose Sarney a supporter of the generals for the purely ceremonial post of vicepresident But Neves died before he could take office and Sarney took power He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado Plan was wildly popular with inflationweary Brazilians But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not been the same The country is a rudderless ship said a US Diplomat echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea of how to tackle the economic crisis Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated with criticism coming from the business community the trade unions some of the military the media and political opponents Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarneys decision announced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt A motor industry executive said The business community thinks Brazil should go to the IMF Their rules are sometimes harsh and strict but this is the only way to put the house in order Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium but disagree with other aspects of government policy Since the end of February they have organized national strikes of seamen bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local stoppages and protests Economic problems have prompted criticism from some military figures including the last army ruler General Joao Figueiredo It is a sign of the times that almost daily military men deny there is going to be a coup If the army does stay in the barracks the key arbitors of Sarneys fate will be the PMDBs leaders So far they have not taken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections But one PMDB leader Senator Affonso Camargo pointedly said yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the Consituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency whenever it wished In the media Sarney has to contend with strong criticism One senior political commentator Fernando Pedreira of the Jornal do Brasil wrote in the newspaper last week President Sarney is  a man of good intentions but it is just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state of the country and the people since the immense failure of the Cruzado Plan The disappointment the frustration the irritation the enticement have been and continue to be too great too profoundHe called for direct elections early in 1988 as the only way out of the present crisis One of Sao Paulos leading news magazines Senhor said in an editorial this week The anarchopopulist government of President Jose Sarney has failed Two years have already been too long for such a disastrous experience It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible The natural solution direct elections soon The governments inability to control inflation is now bringing with it serious social problems An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens of thousands of families onto the streets because they can no longer afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums The local press says the city is experiencing the biggest wave of land invasions in its history According to rental agencies rents have increased 500 pct in little more than a year Even the cheapest shacks now cost 2000 cruzados 90 dollars a month half as much again as the minimum wage which is all that many earn Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sao Paulo warned yesterday of the possibility of a social conflict of unimaginable proportions With his back to the wall politically and with social tensions rising Sarney is no position to compromise on debt"

  "body": "The dollar ended with modest net losses against most major currencies as the market conducted a final round of positionsquaring ahead of tomorrows crucial Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings dealers said The dollar was trendless today People are waiting to see if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then take it from there said one dealer at a top European bank As a result generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded The dollar closed at 1456070 yen down from 1458590 However the dollars yen closing level was comfortably above its overseas low of just under 145 yen Against the mark the dollar finished at 1827080 marks after falling to 18180 in Europe and ending at 1826070 here yesterday In Congressional testimony this morning Fed Chairman Paul Volcker harped on his longheld fears about the potentially catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline He also said the dollars fall thus far should be large enough in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the US to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead The market impact of Volckers comments was minimal It was the same old story Volcker was just fulfilling his role as a defender of the currency said one trader The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawas upbeat appraisal of his hourlong conversation with US Treasury Secretary James Baker this afternoon Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the US has played in coordinated international efforts to prop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement Miyazawa can talk until hes blue in the face The only person who will make a difference is Baker said Alan Rose of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles The key question for the currency market is whether the Reagan administration will have a change of view to the dollar If not the dollar is going lower he added The dollars recent tumble to a 40year low of 14470 yen was linked to the markets perception that Washington was unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least disruptive way of accelerating the process While most analysts do not expect any marked change of attitude in Washington they were reluctant to open any fresh positions until later in the week We are reserving judgement for the time being said Doug Madison of Commerzbank Ag The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling trading today The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at 1617585 and edged up to 2957 marks from 2955 yesterday However underlying sentiment remains positive after a UK opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest popularity rating since it was reelected in 1983 Sterling still seems to be on the firm side said one dealer The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger tone rising to 1305560 to its US counterpart from 1308085 yesterday According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co the dollars tradeweighted value at midday was 57 pct below average market rates in 198082 compared with 55 pct yesterday"

  "title": "TEXAS MAY CONSIDER INCOME TAX TO SOLVE BUDGET WOES",
  "body": "The State of Texas faced with a record 58 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years may have to consider introducing income taxeconomic analysts said Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when the states enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily allowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate income tax However last years dramatic slump in oil prices not only sent the Texas economy into a tailspin but cut heavily into the states tax revenues Both Moodys Investor Services and Standard and Poors cut their credit ratings of the state to double A from the top triple A in early March Moodys Vice President George W Leung said it was the first time Texas rating had been lowered since 1962 adding the report noted that while the Legislature is now considering proposals to restore budget balance medium term prospects for full recovery are weak With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by State Comptroller Bob Bullock the Texas Legislature must grapple with a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 48 billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium No other state in US history has faced such a deficit There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five years ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature would institute an income tax said George Bland Assistant Professor of Political Science at North Texas State University adding Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me its coming its inevitable its only a matter of time State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally supplied as much as a third of the states revenues However that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent years and with last years price slump the states dependence on sales taxes is approaching 50 pct Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major factor in the states decision because under it sales taxes are no longer deductible from federal income tax while state income tax is John Kennedy senior research associate at the Austinbased Texas Research League said There is a great deal of popular sentiment against it plus the first plank of Governor Clements platform was no tax increases let alone a new tax However he said that since the oil price fall the state faced a choice of either instituting an income tax or broadening and possibly raising the sales tax Steve Pejovich director of the Center for Free Enterprise at Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes said he favored reforming the present tax system to take account of the changed structure of the economy We should rely less on traditional sources such as oil and agriculture and real estate and more on service industries manufacturing and hightech Pejovich said Tony Proffitt an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock said Bullock is opposed to an income tax but has warned the Legislature that if they get tired of looking at everything else thats the only option Apart from Texas states which have no individual income tax are Alaska Florida Nevada New Hampshire South Dakota Washington and Wyoming For the time being Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled that the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr deficit into the next biennium even though the state consitution requires a balanced budget But as State Treasurer Ann Richards said last Thursday Jim Mattoxs decision today turns the heat down on the pressure cooker but we must not think that the goose isnt still cooking Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending cuts But the state is already under pressure from a Federal District Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system  or face 24 mln dlrs a month in fines And US Education Secretary William Bennett has accused the state among others of lax education reform Earlier this year both houses of the Legislature citing financial restraints as well as teacher morale passed bills abandoning plans to require teachers to take competency tests Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission next year to study alternative revenue sources with an income tax being instituted as early as January 1989 If the political leaders are educated about the effects of the Tax Reform Act I think there will be a gradual drift toward income tax he said"
